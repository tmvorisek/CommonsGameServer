<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The goal is to make more money than your competitors over the next 25 years.</li>
	<li>Each year, you will be able to choose one of four actions: <span class="sustainText">Sustain</span>, <span class="overharvestText">Overharvest</span>, <span class="policeText">Police</span>, and <span class="restoreText">Restore</span>.</li>
    <li>These actions affect a commons index that represents the health of the fishery.</li>
	<li>The commons index determines how profitable fishing will be that year.</li>
    <li>The fishery is unregulated, so it will be up to YOU to propose new regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Commons Index</h1>
<ul>
    <li>The commons index shows how healthy the fishery is.</li>
    <li>A high index means the fishery is healthy. Thus, the higher the index, the more profitable fishing will be.</li>
    <li>Players can choose to negatively affect the index for more money by choosing to overharvest. This will make fishing next year less profitable though.</li>
    <li>Players can also choose to restore the index, but the index will only increase if no one overharvested that year.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Years</h1>
<ul>
	<li>You must choose an action for each year until the next summit.</li>
	<li>At the end of the summit, you will be shown your profits for those years.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Actions</h1>
<ol>
<li>
    <h3 class="sustainText">Sustain</h3>
    <p>Collect a sustainable amount of money. The commons index is not affected by this action.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3 class="overharvestText">Overharvest</h3>
    <p>Collect an unsustainable amount of money for more profit. The commons index is negatively affected by this action.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3 class="policeText">Police</h3>
    <p>Pay some money to catch anyone trying to overharvest. Anyone overharvesting loses their catch and is fined. The cost of this action is split among all the players that choose this action that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3 class="restoreText">Restore</h3>
    <p>Pay some money to restore the commons index. However, if anyone overharvests, this action will have no effect. The cost of this action is split among all the players that choose this action that year.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Summits</h1>
<ul>
	<li>After every 5 years, a summit is held to enact new regulations on the fishery.</li>
	<li>During these summits, you can propose new fishing regulations.</li>
	<li>You can also propose verbal contracts with other players. Be careful though. It's hard to enforce these contracts.</li>
	<li>Players will vote on these proposals before the next summit.</li>
	<li>During the next summit, the voted-in regulations will be put in place.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Regulation Proposals</h1>
<ol>
<li>
    <h3>Overharvest Fine</h3>
    <p>The fine for overharvesting can be increased or decreased.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>Show Player Actions</h3>
    <p>By default, players cannot see what other players do each year. This can be changed so that all actions are visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h3>Verbal Contracts</h3>
    <p>Players can feel free to promise certain things with one another. Be careful though. There is no way to guarantee players will follow through with these contracts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
